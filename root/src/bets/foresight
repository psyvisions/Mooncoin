<h2>Game of Foresight</h2>
<p>This form allows you to create an event with possible conditions for victory. After the event is posted you can bet on either side.</p><p> After the first bet has been placed it can no longer be deleted, so please verify the event information before you submit this form and before you place your bet. <b>When foresight bets are placed two bets are generated, one namecoin bet and one bitcoin bet.</b></p>
<p>Until user profiles and timezone support are fully implemented, all time on the site is based on PST.</p>

<p>Pacific Standard Time does observe daylight savings time so it is currently GMT-7. When summer is over it will be GMT-8. If you find this confusing you can use a  <a href="http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/converter.html">time zone conversion tool</a>.</p>

<p><b>All events must be in Pacific Standard Time (PST). During the summer this is GMT-7.</b></p>
<p>For Starcraft games in Korea, you would subtract 16 hours. <b>Example:</b> 13:10 (1:10pm) KST would be 21:10 (9:10pm) PST.</p>
<p>Note: If your bet ends at midnight, please use 12:01am and 11:59pm to prevent confusion.</p>
