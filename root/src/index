  <p><b>Now with a fully implemented BTC/NMC Exchange!</b></p> 
  <p>Welcome drifters, you have stumbled upon a browser-based (HTML5/JS) online poker site and e-sports betting using virtual currencies. You can begin playing as soon as you register an account and transfer some recently mined bitcoins or namecoins into it. Once on our site they can also be exchanged. </p>

  <p>Bitcoins and Namecoins are divisible down into very small units, and we have tables at very low stakes (as low as 0.1/0.2 mBTC/mNMC, or 0.0001/0.0002 BTC/NMC). At the tables, a single chip is worth 0.01 BTC/NMC. A 1/2 table is really 0.01/0.02 BTC/NMC.</p>

  <p>Privacy and security are high priority, so we do not collect any information about users, except for user name, password
  and, optionally, an email. We store your passwords using strong SHA encryption.</p>

  <p>This project is fully open source under AGPLv3+ (server code) and
  GPLv3+ (html/css/js code) licenses. You can download the latest version following
  "Download sources" in the footer links.</p>

  <p>Also, we really appreciate any bug reports. Please, follow the link "Report bugs"
  in the footer to report a bug in the room. It really helps the community as a whole.</p>
