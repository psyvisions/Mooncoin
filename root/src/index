  <p><b>E-Sports betting with escrow service open!</b></p> 
  <p>Welcome cosmonauts, you have drifted upon a browser-based (HTML5/JS) online poker site and e-sports betting using virtual currencies. You can begin playing as soon as you register an account and transfer some bitcoins or namecoins into it. </p>

  <p>Bitcoins and Namecoins are divisible down into very small units, and we have tables at very low stakes (as low as 0.1/0.2 mBTC, or 0.0001/0.0002 BTC). At the tables, a single chip is worth 0.01 BTC. A 1/2 table is really 0.01/0.02 BTC.</p>

  <p>If you would like to acquire some bitcoins, check the <a href="http://forum.bitcoin.org">Bitcoin forums</a>, or #bitcoin-otc on Freenode IRC.</p>

  <p>Privacy and security are high priority, so we do not collect any information about players, except for user name, password
  and, optionally, an email. We store your passwords using strong SHA encryption.</p>

  <p>This project is fully open source under AGPLv3+ (server code) and
  GPLv3+ (html/css/js code) licenses. You can download the latest version following
  "Download sources" in the footer links.</p>

  <p>Also, we really appreciate any bug reports. Please, follow the link "Report bugs"
  in the footer to report a bug in the room. It really helps the community as a whole.</p>
