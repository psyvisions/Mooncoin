<p>The poker room at mooncoin is built on top of few open source technologies:</p>

<h2>python-poker-network and python-poker-engine</h2>
<p>The backend of our poker room. More information: <a href='http://pokersource.info/'>http://pokersource.info/</a></p>

<h2>jPoker</h2>
<p>A client designed for the poker-network server based on original jPoker client from the authors of poker-network software. More information: <a href='http://pokersource.info/'>http://pokersource.info/</a></p>

<h2>Bitcoin</h2>
<p>Bitcoin - a new technology in digital currencies. The bitcoins network allows players to generate "coins" to use as currency on our website.
Most important: players can't spend twice their "coins" and in the same time generation of new "coins" depends on CPU power. So we effectively
avoid abuse from dishonest players (think about players, who register fresh account, login and go All-In in the first round).</p>

<h2>Namecoin</h2>
<p>Namecoin - a more recent development in digital currencies.The namecoins network allows players to generate "coins" to use as a currency on our site. Using the same source code as bitcoin, they use the economy to drive a p2p DNS. 
Most important: players can't spend twice their "coins" and in the same time generation of new "coins" depends on CPU power. So we effectively

<h2>Catalyst Framework</h2>
<p><a href='http://www.catalystframework.org'>Catalyst Framework</a> - a modern perl web-framework for rapid web development and easy refactoring.
This framework used to build user interface allowing user register, deposit, withdrawal, list tables, exchange, betting etc. Using catalyst framework we know that
future expansion is possible and practical. To learn more: <a href='http://www.catalystframework.org'>http://www.catalystframework.org</a></p>

<h2>jQuery</h2>
<p><a href='http://jquery.com'>jQuery</a> - great Javascript library allowing us to create dynamic applications inside a browser.</p>

<h2>Apache, MySQL, Perl, Python</h2>
<p>Without these mooncoin would not be possible.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Mooncoin would also like to give a special thanks to pavel for being the first to glue the poker room together and begin testing. We hope to continue to expand his project as well as continue to add games and currencies.</p>
