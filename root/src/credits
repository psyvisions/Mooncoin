<p>The poker room at mooncoin is built on top of few open source technologies:</p>

<h2>python-poker-network and python-poker-engine</h2>
<p>Both used to build "back end" for this poker room. More information: <a href='http://pokersource.info/'>http://pokersource.info/</a></p>

<h2>jPoker</h2>
<p>Client for poker-network server based on original jPoker client from authors of poker-network software. More information: <a href='http://pokersource.info/'>http://pokersource.info/</a></p>

<h2>Bitcoin</h2>
<p>Bitcoin - new technology for digital currencies. Bitcoins network allows players generate "coins" and use as payment in our poker room.
Most important: players can't spend twice their "coins" and in the same time generation of new "coins" depends on CPU power. So we effectively
avoid abuse from dishonest players (think about players, who register fresh account, login and go All-In in the first round).</p>

<h2>Namecoin</h2>
<p>Namecoin - new technology for digital currencies. namecoins network allows players generate "coins" and use as payment in our poker room. Using the same source code as bitcoin, they use the economy to drive a p2p DNS. 
Most important: players can't spend twice their "coins" and in the same time generation of new "coins" depends on CPU power. So we effectively

<h2>Catalyst Framework</h2>
<p><a href='http://www.catalystframework.org'>Catalyst Framework</a> - modern perl web framework for rapid web development and easy refactoring.
This framework used to build user interface allowing user register, deposit, withdrawal, list tables, etc. Using catalyst framework we know that
if we will need to adopt to something new in future we can do this easily. To learn more: <a href='http://www.catalystframework.org'>http://www.catalystframework.org</a></p>

<h2>jQuery</h2>
<p><a href='http://jquery.com'>jQuery</a> - great Javascript library allowing us to create really dynamic applications inside browser.</p>

<h2>Apache, MySQL, Perl, Python</h2>
<p>Without these no web application were possible.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Mooncoin would also like to give a special thanks to pavel for being the first to glue the poker room together and begin testing. We hope to continue to expand his project as well as continue to add games and currencies.</p>
